# 🚀 ICO Token Sale Platform (React + Web3)

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) built with React and Ethers.js that enables users to participate in a token presale. Users can connect their wallets and buy tokens using the native token of the blockchain (e.g., ETH on Ethereum, BNB on BSC) or other whitelisted tokens, depending on the network and deployment settings.

The platform is powered by a smart contract that handles token distribution securely and transparently. Only approved tokens are allowed for purchase, and the token sale respects whitelist rules defined by the deployer.
